[*here you can download the cheatsheet*](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  

## Introduction 
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

## Technical
- Language : Python (filetype: *.ipynb*)

## Content
You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

### Feature :
- **Customer ID** — Unique ID assigned to the customer.
- **Gender** — Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age** — Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)** — Annual Income of the customee.
- **Spending Score** — Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

## What We Got From This Program
By the end of this case study , you would be able to answer below questions.
- How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning algorithm (KMeans Clustering) in Python in simplest way.
- Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy.
- How the marketing strategy works in real world.

## Step Inside The Program
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Clustering (4 Variables)**
- **Clustering (Age & Annual Income & Spending Score)**
- **Clustering (Age & Annual Income)**
- **Clustering (Annual Income & Spending Score)**
- **Clustering (Age & Spending Score)**
